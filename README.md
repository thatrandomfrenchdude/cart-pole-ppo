</p>

This project demonstrates a complete reinforcement learning pipeline using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) across **four different physics-based environments**. It includes custom implementations of CartPole, MountainCar, Pendulum, and Acrobot environments, a PPO agent that supports both discrete and continuous actions, and a web-based visualization interface to observe training progress in real-time.

The application allows you to run a pre-trained model in example mode, or train a new model from scratch. It supports multiple model formats including PyTorch, TorchScript, and ONNX, making it flexible for different deployment scenarios. I've also built in a conversion script to convert PyTorch models to ONNX format for use with Qualcomm AI Hub, enabling NPU acceleration on Snapdragon devices.

- **Reward**: -1.0 per step until goal reached, 0.0 when goal achieved
- **Solved**: Average reward of -100+ over 100 consecutive episodes

## Quick Start
By default, the application runs a pretrained CartPole model in **example mode**. You'll see a real-time simulation with live metrics demonstrating "perfect" balancing behavior without requiring training time.

**To enable model training**, flip the `example_mode` setting under `training` to `false`:

## Environment Selection
Choose which environment to train/run by modifying the `game` section in `config.yaml`:

```yaml
game:
  environment: "cartpole"  # Options: "cartpole", "mountain_car", "pendulum", "acrobot"
```

Each environment has its own:
- **Model save path**: Separate models for each environment type
- **Example model path**: Pre-trained models for demonstration
- **Solved threshold**: Environment-specific success criteria
- **Network architecture**: Automatically configured input/output dimensions

**To enable model training**, flip the `example_mode` setting under `training` to `false`:
```yaml
training:
  # some other settings...
  example_mode: false
  # some other settings...
```

### Prerequisites
Requires either Python 3.8+ with dependencies installed or Docker and Docker Compose. Use the appropriate method in the run instructions below.

### Setup
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/thatrandomfrenchdude/cart-pole-ppo.git
   cd cart-pole-ppo
   ```
2. Configure the environment:
   ```bash
   # python
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Run the Tests
Run the tests to ensure everything is working correctly. The tests cover unit tests, integration tests, and performance tests.
1. Install test dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements-test.txt
   ```

2. Run the tests:
   ```bash
   # On Linux/macOS
   chmod +x scripts/run_tests.sh
   ./scripts/run_tests.sh all
   
   # On Windows (PowerShell)
   .\scripts\run_tests.ps1 all
   ```

### Run the Application
1. Run the application server:
   ```bash
   # python
   python main.py

   # docker
   docker-compose up
   ```

2. Open your web browser and go to: `http://localhost:8080`

## Model Formats
The application supports multiple model formats for flexibility:
- **PyTorch**: `.pth` files
- **TorchScript**: `.pt` files  
- **ONNX**: `.onnx` files

For training, the default model format is PyTorch and cannot be changed. In example mode, the model can be in any of the supported formats. The application will automatically detect the format based on the file extension.

### Environment-Specific Model Paths
Each environment has its own model configuration in `config.yaml`:

```yaml
training:
  # Model save paths for each environment
  model_save_paths:
    cartpole: "models/ppo_cartpole.pth"
    mountain_car: "models/ppo_mountain_car.pth"
    pendulum: "models/ppo_pendulum.pth"
    acrobot: "models/ppo_acrobot.pth"
  
  # Example model paths for each environment  
  example_model_paths:
    cartpole: "example/model.pth"
    mountain_car: "example/mountain_car_model.pth"
    pendulum: "example/pendulum_model.pth"
    acrobot: "example/acrobot_model.pth"
```

### Example Models
Examples of all three model formats can be found in the `example` directory:
```example/
├── model.pth        # PyTorch model
├── model.pt         # TorchScript model
└── model.onnx       # ONNX model
```
You can compare the performance of these models by activating the virtual environment and running the `compare_models.py` script:
```bash
# Activate the virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

# Run the comparison script
python src/compare_models.py # assumes the working directory is the project root
```

### A Note on Model Conversion
The `aihub_conversion.py` script is provided in the `src` directory to convert .pth models to .pt and .onnx using Qualcomm AI Hub. This provides NPU acceleration for the ONNX model when running on a Snapdragon X device. You can also convert the models on your own if you prefer.

## Researcher Notes

### PPO Algorithm Details

The implementation includes:
- **Policy Network**: Outputs action probabilities (discrete) or action mean/std (continuous)
- **Value Network**: Estimates state values for advantage calculation
- **Shared Feature Extraction**: Common layers for both policy and value functions
- **Clipped Surrogate Objective**: Prevents large policy updates
- **Generalized Advantage Estimation**: Improves learning stability
- **Multi-Environment Support**: Handles both discrete and continuous action spaces

#### Training Process

1. **Environment Reset**: Start new episode with random initial state
2. **Action Selection**: 
   - **Discrete environments (CartPole, Acrobot)**: Policy network outputs action probabilities via categorical distribution
   - **Continuous environments (MountainCar, Pendulum)**: Policy network outputs mean and std for normal distribution, actions clipped to [-1, +1] range
3. **Experience Collection**: Store states, actions, rewards, and probabilities
4. **Policy Updates**: Every 200 steps, update the policy using PPO loss
5. **Performance Tracking**: Log episode rewards and training statistics

#### Performance Expectations

Each environment has different solving criteria:
- **CartPole**: Average reward of 195+ over 100 consecutive episodes (max possible: 200+ per episode)
- **MountainCar**: Average reward of 90+ over 100 consecutive episodes (considers goal bonus minus energy costs)
- **Pendulum**: Average reward of -200+ over 100 consecutive episodes (minimize cost function - closer to 0 is better)
- **Acrobot**: Average reward of -100+ over 100 consecutive episodes (fewer negative steps to lift end-effector above first joint)

Training typically shows improvement within the first few episodes. Complete learning usually occurs within 100-500 episodes depending on environment complexity and initialization. Episodes have the following horizons:
- **CartPole**: Variable length (terminates when pole falls or cart goes out of bounds)
- **MountainCar**: Maximum 999 steps (terminates early if goal reached)
- **Pendulum**: Fixed 200 steps per episode
- **Acrobot**: Maximum 500 steps (terminates early if end-effector raised above first joint level)

### Customization with the Configuration File
The [`config.yaml`](config.yaml) file allows you to customize all aspects of training. There are sections for environment parameters, neural network architecture, PPO hyperparameters, training settings, server configuration, and logging.
